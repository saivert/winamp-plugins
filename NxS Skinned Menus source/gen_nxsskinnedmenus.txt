NxS Skinned Menus plug-in - ReadMe

  Overview
----------
  This plug-in skins the popup menus of Winamp.

  Tech info
-----------
  This plug-in uses MFC because I'm using a class written by dan.g to do the skinning.
  I though I could write a plug-in for Winamp which uses this so Winamp gets cool menus as well.

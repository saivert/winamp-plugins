  Whats new?
------------
  Version 0.7
  - Added feature: Do not fade songs shorter than X seconds.
    This feature is a bit buggy. It enforces fading of all songs longer than
	X seconds disregarding if user wants fading or not.
	Turn this off if you don't want consecutive fading.
  - Code cleanups. Moved init stuff into subclass of Winamp,
    posting message at plug-in init.

    to the people.
  Version 0.64
